#### JBrowse main configuration file

## uncomment the section below to customize this browser's title and description
[aboutThisBrowser]
title = SARS-CoV-2 browser 
description = This browser is produced from a Dockerfile at
  https://github.com/GMOD/sars-cov-2-jbrowse
  The idea is to quickly have a JBrowse instance for genomes that attract
  wide interest.  The first instance of this was for the 
  SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak in 2020. For information about the data
  in any of the tracks, select the "About this track" option from the menu you get
  from clicking on the "in track" label. For information about this
  genome browser, feel free to contact Scott Cain at scott@scottcain.net.

## uncomment and edit the example below to configure a faceted track selector
# [trackSelector]
# type = Faceted
# displayColumns =
#   + label
#   + key
#   + organism
#   + technique
## optionally sort the faceted track selector by column (use the names from displayColumns)
# initialSortColumn=label
## optionally give different names to some of the data facets using renameFacets
# [trackSelector.renameFacets]
# submission = Submission ID
# developmental-stage = Conditions
# cell-line = Cell Line
# key = Dataset
# label = Track

## uncomment this section to get hierarchical trackselector options
# [trackSelector]
## optionally turn off sorting for the hierarchical track selector
# sortHierarchical = false
## set collapsed categories for the hierarchical track selector
# collapsedCategories = Reference sequence,Quantitative / XY Plot
## set category ordering in the hierarchical track selector
# categoryOrder = BAM, Transcripts, Quantitative/Density, VCF

## configure where to get metadata about tracks.  always indexes the
## `metadata` part of each track config, but this can be used to load
## additional metadata from CSV or JSON urls
# [trackMetadata]
# sources = data/trackMetadata.csv


[GENERAL]


## add a document.domain to set the same-origin policy
# documentDomain=foobar.com

## use classic jbrowse menu with file instead of track and genome
classicMenu = true

## hide open genome option
#hideGenomeOptions = true

## enable or disable high resolution rendering for canvas features. set to auto, disabled, or numerical scaling factor. default: 2
highResolutionMode=4

## uncomment to change the default sort order of the reference
## sequence dropdown
refSeqOrder = false

## Uncomment to prevent HTML tracks from displaying gene subfeatures (enabled by default)
# inferHTMLSubfeatures = false

## to set a default data directory other than 'data', uncomment and
## edit the line below
# dataRoot = data

## optionally add more include statements to load and merge in more
## configuration files
include  = {dataRoot}/trackList.json
include += {dataRoot}/tracks.conf
# include += ../url/of/my/other/config.json
# include += another_config.conf

## uncomment and edit the example below to enable one or more
## JBrowse plugins
# [ plugins.MyPlugin ]
# location = plugins/MyPlugin
# [ plugins.AnotherPlugin ]
# location = ../plugin/dir/someplace/else
# removing this for now--it seems to have a hard time with vcf tracks
#[plugins.ScreenShotPlugin]
#location = plugins/ScreenShotPlugin
[ plugins.ColorByCDS ]
location = plugins/colorbycds
[ plugins.MAFViewer ]
location = plugins/MAFViewer
[ plugins.HideTrackLabels ]
location = plugins/HideTrackLabels


## edit the datasets list below to add datasets to the jbrowse dataset
## selector

[datasets.SARS-CoV-2]
url = ?data=data/SARS-CoV-2
name = SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)

# [datasets.volvox]
# url  = ?data=sample_data/json/volvox
# name = Volvox Example

# [datasets.modencode]
# url  = ?data=sample_data/json/modencode
# name = MODEncode Example

# [datasets.yeast]
# url  = ?data=sample_data/json/yeast
# name = Yeast Example
