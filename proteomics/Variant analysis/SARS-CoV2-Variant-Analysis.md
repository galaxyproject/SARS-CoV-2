## Description

The COVID-19 pandemic continues with the emergence of new strains.As virulence seems to be increasing with each variant, there is a dire need to advance the MS-based diagnostics to identify optimal strain-specific biomarker peptides from non-invasively collected clinical samples.The Galaxy-P Team has developed workflows to detect and validate the SARS-CoV-2 peptides useful for developing targeted MS-based biomarker assays.

## Workflows

Our workflows are divided into two parts
A) Discovery workflow: Where MS/MS data from publicly available & nasopharyngeal patient samples were searched against protein FASTA files from SARS-CoV-2 Wildtype (WT) & variant strains along with Human UniProt & contaminants 
using SearchGUI/Peptide Shaker & MaxQuant search algorithms.Confident peptides were extracted from the peptide results & SARS-CoV-2 peptides were filtered by removing human proteins & contaminants.
We detected 210 SARS-CoV-2 peptides from twelve clinical datasets. These peptides were then added to a panel of 803 peptides to get 908 unique peptides.

B) Verification workflow: In the second workflow, the 908 peptides were verified for their presence in the 12 clinical datasets using PepQuery Tool.The PepQuery Tool ranks the matches of the peptide panel to COVID-19 MS data against a reference proteome 
containing proteins from human and contaminants.Resulting data was filtered to generate a list of confident peptide matches with associated P-values (<0.05) to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.
The peptide list was further analyzed using bioinformatic tool such as BLAST-P. The spectral quality of these verified peptides was inspected manually using Lorikeet tool within the Multi-omics Viewing Platform (MVP). 
Verified peptides were further investigated to extract additional information using the GSAID repository and then the peptides were manually aligned to the SARS-SoV2- Wild type sequence for variant identification.

## Results

Most of the verified strain-specific peptides, align to the nucleocapsid, and spike proteins of the viral proteome and would serve as the optimal targets for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 strains.
The flexibility of the Galaxy workflows has the potential to detect the emerging strains on newly published MS datasets (DDA or parallel-reaction-monitoring (PRM)).Â  We are expanding our peptide panel to 
include peptide targets to detect emerging strains.
