Mass spectrometry (MS) based datasets (both from peer-reviewed manuscripts and preprint version) are now available
via [ProteomeXchange](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/corona-mass-kb.jsp) and
[PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive?filter=project_tags_facet%3D%3DSars-cov-2). Here, we demonstrate the use of
Galaxy workflows to reanalyze MS datasets ranging from gargle solutions ([PXD018682](PXD018682)),
deep proteomic analysis ([PXD018804](PXD018804)) to protein-protein interaction ([PXD018117](PXD018594)).
We also extend the original analysis of these datasets by use of post-search analysis validation  with open-source software tools.
