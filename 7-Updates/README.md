# Analysis of additional data

## February 24, 2020: New data is exceptionaly sloppy

As of the morning of Feb 24, 2020 there are 11 additional datasets that appeared at the [COVID-19 data page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/) maintained by the [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). They can be viewed using [SRA run selector](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRR10903401%2CSRR10903402%2CSRR10902284%2CSRR10948474%2CSRR10948550%2CSRR10971381%2CSRR11092058%2CSRR11092057%2CSRR11092056%2CSRR11092064%2CSRR11085797%2CSRR11085737%2CSRR11085740%2CSRR11085733%2CSRR11085736%2CSRR11085738%2CSRR11085741&o=acc_s%3Aa&s=SRR11085797,SRR10948474,SRR10948550,SRR10903402,SRR11092056,SRR11085741,SRR11085737,SRR11085740,SRR11085738,SRR11085733,SRR10902284,SRR11092064,SRR11092057,SRR11085736,SRR10903401,SRR11092058,SRR10971381).

The accessions of new datasets are:

```
SRR11085797
SRR11092056
SRR11085741
SRR11085737
SRR11085740
SRR11085738
SRR11085733
SRR11092064
SRR11092057
SRR11085736
SRR11092058
```

Of these four (SRR11092056, SRR11092057, SRR11092058, SRR11092064) are human metatranscriptomic samples while others (SRR11085797, RR11085741, SRR11085737, SRR11085740, SRR11085738, SRR11085733, SRR11085736) are metatranscriptomic samples from bat anal swabs. 

### New human data

First we analyzed the new human sequences represented by SRR11092056, SRR11092057, SRR11092058, SRR11092064. All these datasets share the same bioproject id [PRJNA605983](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA605983). The PRJNA605983 lists a total of nine SRA accessions: five more in addition to the four listed above.

We attempted to download and analyze these data. 

Results are coming soon ...
