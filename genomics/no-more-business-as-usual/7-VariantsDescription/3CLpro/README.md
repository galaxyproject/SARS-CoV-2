# 3CL protease or Main protease

Coronavirus proteases are classified into 2 types :
 -   __Accessory proteases__ : clean the more divergent N-proximal pp1a/pp1ab regions at 2/3 of sites.
 -   __Main proteases__ : cleave major part of polyprotein at 11 conserved sites and release conserved key replicative functions like RdRp, helicase, and 3 of the RNA processing domains.
All coronaviruses encode 1 main protease and 1 or 2 accessory proteases. Accessory proteases are Papain-like cysteine
proteases designated as PL<sup>pro</sup> .

##### Main protease M<sup>pro</sup> / 3CL<sup>pro</sup>
The order of cleavage is strictly conserved among corona viruses and depend on accessibility of specific sites in the
polyprotein and on the primary and secondary structures of a given cleavage site.
3CL<sup>pro</sup> is encoded by ORF1a and resides in nsp5. In the polyprotein, it is flanked by hydrophobic domains. It directs the proteolytic processing of all downstream domains of pp1a/pp1ab.
Cov 3CL<sup>pro</sup> have a chymotrypsin-like, two-&beta;-barrel fold that is formed by 12 antiparallel &beta;-strands. They
have a C-terminal etension, called domain III, comprising 103 a.a. and 5 &alpha;-helices that adopt a unique structure that differs from the corresponding domain of other viruses.
3CL pro in coviruses use a catalytic dyad consisting of Cys (nucleophile) and His (general base).

It may lack a counterpart to the catalytic Asp(or Glu) found in other CLike proteases. In TGEV 3CL structure, a buried water molecule was found in the place that is normally occupied by the 3rd member of the triad (Asp or Glu).


The substrate specificity of coronavirus 3CL<sup>pro</sup>s is similar to other 3C and 3C-like proteases: all the coronavirus 3CL<sup>pro</sup> sites share a Gln residue at the P1 position, and small residues (Ala, Ser, Gly) are conserved at the P10 position. Larger residues, such as Asn (found at P10 of all coronavirus nsp8|nsp9 sites), lead to decreased cleavage efficiency. P2 position of coronavirus 3CL<sup>pro</sup> substrates is most often occupied by a Leu, but other hydrophobic residues (Ile, Val, Phe, and Met) can sometimes be found at this position. On P4 position, small residues are found most of the time (Val, Thr, Ser, Pro, and Ala). Studies found that the P region of 3CL<sup>pro</sup> substrates binds in a shallow groove at the surface of the protease, between domains I and II. Residues P5 to P3 form an antiparallel &beta;-sheet with residues 164–167 and residues 189–191 of the loop linking domain II and III of 3CL<sup>pro</sup> in HCoV-229E (a deletion in the loop inactivate the proteolytic activity).
Tyr161 (in SARS-2-CoV) is part of the conserved coronavirus 3CL<sup>pro</sup> signature, Tyr-X-His, instead of Gly(Ala)-X-His  found at the equivalent position in most 3C and 3C-like proteases.
